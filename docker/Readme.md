## Docker
I used Docker for this project as edge devices are constantly being updated and improved, so I wanted to make sure that there was an environment pre built that would ensure that this could be deployed in the future without having to make many changes. The Jetpack SDK also comes with support for Docker , so it is very easy to use when working with the Jetson Nano.To build this Dockerfile, simply navigative to this directory and run Docker/build.sh. After creating the DockerFile, you have to run Docker/run.sh to activate the container. The file DockerReference in this directory is how your file should look.
